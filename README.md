# Machine_Learning-Diabetes_Prediction

## 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict diabetes using a dataset containing medical and demographic data. The goal is to explore the relationships between various features and the likelihood of developing diabetes and to practice applying multiple machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.

## 2. Dataset Description
We used the Diabetes Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes numerical and categorical data related to the patientâ€™s medical history and demographic information. The features and their descriptions are as follows:

* **Age**: Patient's age (in years).
* **Gender**: Patient's gender (Male, Female, or Other).
* **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat.
* **Hypertension**: Indicates if the patient has high blood pressure (Yes/No).
* **Heart Disease**: Presence of heart disease (Yes/No).
* **Smoking History**: Smoking habits of the patient (never, former, current).
* **HbA1c Level**: Average blood sugar levels over the past three months.
* **Blood Glucose Level**: Current blood glucose level (mg/dL).
* **Diabetes**: Target variable indicating if the patient has diabetes (Positive/Negative).

This dataset is a rich resource for building predictive models and gaining insights into diabetes risk factors.

## 3. Why This Project?
We chose this topic for the following reasons:

* **Understanding Diabetes**: To gain a deeper understanding of diabetes, its associated risk factors, and its impact on health.
* **Machine Learning Practice**: To strengthen our knowledge and skills in machine learning by implementing and comparing different algorithms.
* **Hands-On Learning**: To apply theoretical concepts learned in class to a practical dataset and problem.

## 4. Algorithms Implemented
We applied the following seven machine learning algorithms, each with specific goals:

* **Decision Tree**: For an interpretable classification model that provides insights into feature importance.
* **Random Forest**: To improve accuracy by combining multiple decision trees and reducing overfitting.
* **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)**: To enhance performance by combining weak classifiers into a strong one.
* **Logistic Regression**: To establish a baseline for binary classification with interpretability.
* **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: To maximize the decision boundary for class separation.
* **Gradient Boosting**: For enhanced accuracy by sequentially correcting errors in predictions.
* **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: To explore deep learning and its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.

## 5. Acknowledgments

We hope this project helps in understanding the application of machine learning algorithms to healthcare data and provides actionable insights into diabetes prediction and prevention.
